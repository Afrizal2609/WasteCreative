## About The Project

Did you know, Based on data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), 42.33% of waste in Indonesia comes from household activities. Household waste is the largest waste of the amount of waste generated. Household waste causes many negative impacts, it can cause illness that affect our wellbeing. It too can cause natural harm and contamination. Since all of that, it'll in the long run have an affect on social life of the community

Based on these problems, we are curious, how can we reduce the amount of household waste generated? Then we thought of a solution to create an android application that can help reduce the amount of household waste generated, namely WasteCreative. WasteCreative is an android application that can detect household waste objects and suggest crafts that can be made based on the detection results. We will also create a marketplace for buying and selling user-generated crafts. Besides being able to reduce the amount of household waste, this application also has the potential to help raise MSMEs in the creative industry welfare. This is the reason why we want to solve this problem.
